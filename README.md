# MIT-MATLAB-Open-Courseware

The website for all the courseware: [MIT MATLAB OpenCourseware](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-094-introduction-to-matlab-january-iap-2010/index.htm)

This file has 5 parts, names "IAPMALTAB\day_".

In each day, there is a lecture note and an assignment. Also, It contains my homework for the assignment.

I meet some problems dealing with photo processing in assignment 4. If you can solve these problems, do not hesitate to pull new request in this repository. Also, I will try me best to learn more and solve all the problems ASAP.
