# MIT-MATLAB-Open-Courseware

The website for all the courseware: http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-094-introduction-to-matlab-january-iap-2010/index.htm

This file has 5 parts, names "IAPMALTAB\day_".

In each day, there is a lecture note and an assignment. Also, It contains my homework for the assignment.

I am not able to complete all the tasks right now (2015.12.29), especially for homework 4. I meet some problems dealing with Julia set (a kind of fractal geometry) and photo processing. If you can solve these problems, do not hesitate to pull new request in this repository. Also, I will try me best to learn more and solve all the problems ASAP.
